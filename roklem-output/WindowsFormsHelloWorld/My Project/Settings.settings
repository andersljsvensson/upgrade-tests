<!-- Changes: 
1. Set UseMySettingsClassName to "false" as .NET Core does not support MySettings class.
2. Moved away from unsupported packages. 
3. Retained the structure for settings but noted that usage will require alternative approaches in .NET Core. 
No other changes to the original structure are needed as it's primarily a metadata file. -->
