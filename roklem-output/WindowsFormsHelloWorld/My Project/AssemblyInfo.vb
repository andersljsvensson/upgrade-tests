' Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
'
'      Major Version
'      Minor Version
'      Build Number
'      Revision
'
<Assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")>
<Assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")>

' Changes made:
' 1. Removed dependency on Microsoft.VisualBasic as it is not migratable. 
' 2. Confirmed the issue with System.Web and System.Data.OracleClient but did not implement any migration code here since they pertain to functionalities outside of AssemblyInfo.vb. 
' 3. No changes to functionality were necessary since AssemblyInfo.vb handles metadata, which remains compatible with .NET Core in this structure. 
' 4. Ensure to replace any usages of non-migratable libraries in the application code accordingly.
