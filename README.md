# VB.NET Migration Tool Testing Instructions
This document provides instructions for a team of developers doing the manual migration within the user-study of the Roklem migration tool, which migrates projects from VB.NET Framework to VB.NET Core. You will receive two sample projects and your goal is to migrate them to .net core.

## Description
You will complete two tasks:
1. A warm-up task to get familiar with migrating projects from .net framework to .net core. (maximum ~20 minutes of time)
2. A main task using a different project.

In both tasks, your goal is to produce a compilable and runnable version of the application in .net core. You are free to choose what .net core version you migrate to.
